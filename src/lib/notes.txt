Can we address whether or not metaphysics is important without knowing what
metaphysics is?
A.​ One does not need to know precisely what a thing is in order to investigate it in
some degree
1.​ Ex. You can go ghost hunting without knowing precisely what a ghost is
B.​ We just need impressions surrounding the word to start an investigation over the
subject
1.​ We already have a level of familiarity with what the word “metaphysics”
is as we have a level of familiarity with what a “ghost” is
2.​ Our impressions are accompanied with various actions that we associate
with a word
a)​ Ex. Metaphysics is associated abstract, impractical, and
nonscientific
3.​ We can use the impressions of metaphysics to begin to address whether or
not it is important
a)​ Ex. against metaphysics being valuable:
P1. All purely abstract pursuits are unimportant
P2. Metaphysics is a purely abstract pursuit
C: Therefore metaphysics is unimportant
Arguments against the value of metaphysics
A.​ Metaphysics may not be valuable because it is difficult to “do” or properly
understand
1.​ Counter: One’s ability to do a thing does not give a thing importance
a)​ Ex. Math is important regardless of whether or not one can do it
2.​ Metaphysics may not be valuable because it cannot contribute to progress
like science does
a)​ Metaphysical views may be unable to be established as true or
false or are neither true or false
(1)​Counter: A belief can be true while not having a way of
determining its truth
B.​ Metaphysics may be too abstract and removed from real and practical things
C.​ Metaphysics may be too cold, rationalistic, and impersonal
1.​ There is only real value in community, empathy, and warmth which
metaphysics does not provide
Response to the arguments against the value of metaphysics
A.​ Is metaphysics unimportant because it cannot be settled or subjected to scientific
examination?
1.​ Metaphysics provides consistency of language and concepts of
understanding the full realm of human experience
a)​ Arguably functions as higher end scientific theory
b)​ Metaphysical theories are ordered like scientific theories as they
are both falsifiable
(1)​Metaphysical theories tend to be more general than
scientific theories
2.​ Metaphysics attempts to fundamentally and rationally understand the order
of things ranging from broad perspective to everyday experiences

3.​ Hume’s claim that value comes from quantifiability or experimental/
scientific methodology is a contradiction
a)​ Humen’s claim on human understanding uses neither, thereby
making his claims useless by his own standards
4.​ Hume’s view leads to absurd consequences
a)​ Not all facts are known by the scientific method
B.​ Is metaphysics useless because it is too abstract and impractical?
1.​ The claim of “all abstract things are unimportant” is not true
a)​ Ex. higher mathematics are abstract yet important
b)​ Rational pursuits have intrinsic and not just practical value
c)​ There are two notions of abstract
(1)​Abstraction is being positively removed from reality
(a)​ Unhelpful view that one can be rightly critical of
(2)​Abstraction is thinking of something independently from
said thing being real
(a)​ Helps us to begin to understand parts of reality we
have no experienced but are metaphysically
possible
2.​ The claim of “metaphysics is impractical” is not true
a)​ Our theoretical commitments direct our behavior even without
pursuing theoretical questions for purely practical reasons
b)​ Metaphysical world views are inescapable
(1)​We often express metaphysical judgements about the world
in our daily interactions and worldviews
C.​ Is metaphysics unimportant because it is isolating and is unfeeling?
1.​ We should integrate our empathetic, practical, and social interests with
metaphysical points of view
a)​ Ex. Slaves and masters in American history being a metaphysical
perspective that forgot empathy
II.​
I.​

Definitions
A.​ A definition is the meaning of something, not what something is
1.​ Ex: A circle is a figure, but a figure is not a circle
a)​ Socrates seeks to find what is the same among many different
things
(1)​Ex: A figure is the limits of a surface
B.​ Intentional vs Extensional Definition
1.​ Intentional definition: That thing which all things called virtuous have in
common
2.​ Extensional definition: List of things with a common nature
3.​ The importance of definition is that it aids us in taking hold of a thing in a
way that prevents us from slipping away from our mental grasp of it
a)​ Extensional definitions leave room for misapplication of names in
certain circumstances

II.​

III.​

I.​

b)​ Understanding the true application of terms to all things which
they apply results in progress toward truth in judgements
C.​ Techniques in which intentional definitions are obtained
1.​ Definitions by way of genus and specific difference
a)​ Begin with broad concept and narrow it to fit only things in which
the term applies
b)​ The necessary and sufficient conditions for the true application of a
term
(1)​Find what is true of the correct application of a thing
(2)​The term will contain features that are not true of other
things which are termed
(a)​ Find necessary and sufficient conditions to narrow
Contradiction and Counter Example
A.​ Socrates often won an argument by leading his opponent to contradict himself or
admit other beliefs that are contrary to the original claim
1.​ Assert a claim as true but realize in the argument that they believe the
opposite
a)​ Ex. Socrates vs Theaetetus on knowledge
B.​ Counter example plays an important role in metaphysics
1.​ To disprove universal claims that all S is/is not P, demonstrate a case
where some S is not/is P
2.​ It is possible to refute particular claims such as some S is P
Socrates as midwife for truth
A.​ Justification: Rational support or evidence for thinking that a particular belief is
true
1.​ We must seek reasons for believing in the things we believe
B.​ The role of the philosopher is to help people give birth to truth
1.​ Suggests we all have an internal relationship to the truth
2.​ Must build on prior knowledge and apply reasoning to discover new truths
C.​ Socrates believes the job of reason is to aid us in remembering again what we
have forgotten
Plato’s divided line
D.​ The world of appearances
1.​ Visible Realm
a)​ The closer you are to the visible realm, the further you are from the
truth and reality
b)​ Two sections:
(1)​The state of illusion(eikasia)
(a)​ The state in which images exist
(i)​ The furthest state from truth
(ii)​ State of shadows and reflections
(iii)​ Tree example
(a)​ You are looking at the shadow of the
tree rather than the actual tree

(b)​Shadows can change forms and are a
vague image of the real thing
(2)​ The state of belief(pistis)
(a)​ The state in which objects exist
(i)​ Second furthest state from the truth
(ii)​ State of animals and man made items
(iii)​ State in which we use our senses
(a)​ Plato does not believe we can get
knowledge from our senses
(3)​The states of illusion and belief result in opinion(doxa)
E.​ The world of the forms
1.​ Intelligible Realm
a)​ The closer you got to the intelligible realm, the closer you got to
truth and reality
b)​ Two sections:
(1)​The state of mathematical reasoning(dianola)
(a)​ Second closest state to truth
(b)​The state in which some ideas exist
(i)​ Mathematical forms and geometry
(c)​ Plato believes math is one of the closest things to
math we can get in our world
(i)​ Perfect straight line/perfect triangle
(a)​ Ideas we can conjure from math that
are impossible for us to achieve in
the material world
(2)​The state of intelligence(noesis)
(a)​ Closest state to truth
(b)​The state in which pure ideas exist
(i)​ Forms(eidos) and philosophy
(c)​ We can access the forms through minds
(3)​The states of mathematical reasoning and intelligence result
in knowledge(episteme)
I.​

II.​

Methodology
A.​ Nothing characterizes a philosopher’s work more than the methodology they
employ
B.​ Methodology is important to both philosophy and science
Saving the Appearances
A.​ Verifying common beliefs by means of observing the natural world(appearances)
to uphold said common beliefs
1.​ Employs this methodology in both metaphysics and ethics and against
other philosophers
B.​ Employing syllogistic reasoning to determine whether or not a philosophy is
contrary to a known conclusion
C.​ Man comes to know the truth by objects given through experience

III.​

1.​ Aristotle believes perception is the means through which all knowledge is
attained
a)​ Our concepts and starting point for all knowledge(including
distinct truths) is through and in perceptual experience
b)​ Perception is potentially intelligible
2.​ Aristotle recognizes man makes his own conclusions from basically the
same common pool of experience
D.​ One must carefully weigh reasons for various views and find a view that makes
the most sense of our human experience
1.​ Convince others through this why their philosophy is erroneous
a)​ Ex. Eliminativism
​
P1. All things that really exist are things that can be
understood in principle through empirical science
​
P2. No minds and individual consciousnesses are things
that can be understood in principle through empirical science
​
C. No minds and individual consciousnesses are things that
really exist
(1)​Aristotle would hold that the conclusion is false because it
fails to save the appearances of consciousness and
mindedness
(a)​ One can easily observe their consciousness and
there are things which are beyond what can be
demonstrated by empirical science
Syllogistic Reasoning
A.​ Every belief is true or false
1.​ This applies even if we doubt if it is true or false
B.​ Every basic belief has three component
1.​ Subject
a)​ What the belief is about
b)​ Socrates is philosophical
2.​ Copula
a)​ Expresses that the predicate can be understood to be true of the
subject
b)​ Socrates is philosophical
(1)​Expresses that being philosophical is actually true of
Socrates
3.​ Predicate
a)​ Expresses a property or an attribute
b)​ Has universal features
c)​ Socrates is philosophical
(1)​Philosophical expresses the property of being philosophical
C.​ Quantity and Quality
1.​ Quantity regards the subject and quality regards the predicate
2.​ Quantity: Three kinds
a)​ Universal
(1)​Indicated by the term all

b)​ Particular
(1)​Indicated by the term some
c)​ Singular
(1)​Indicated by a proper name
3.​ Quality
a)​ Whether the predicate is affirmative or negative
(1)​Negativity is indicated by the words not or no
D.​ Four kinds of syllogistic reasoning that involves all of these features
1.​ Universal affirmative beliefs(A Propositions)
a)​ All S is P
2.​ Particular affirmative beliefs(I Propositions)
a)​ Some S is P
3.​ Universal negative beliefs(E propositions)
a)​ All S is not P
4.​ Particular negative beliefs(O propositions)
a)​ Some S is not P
E.​ Syllogisms are special arrangements of beliefs that have premises and conclusions
1.​ A conclusion successfully follows from the premises when it expresses a
valid form and when all premises are true
2.​ False premises do not necessitate a false conclusion
3.​ Only 20 valid syllogisms
4.​ Major term, middle term, minor term
a)​ Major term: First premise and contains middle and major term of
the conclusion
b)​ Minor term: Second premise and contains the middle and minor
term of the conclusion
5.​ Study valid syllogisms
a)​ Create an even playing field for syllogisms by making language
consistent - parameter
I.​
II.​

Modern Science
A.​ Knowledge that is established through the empirical scientific method
Aristotle’s View of Science
A.​ Knowledge that admits of a kind of comprehensiveness, foundation, and stability
1.​ Involves demonstrations
a)​ A valid syllogism which produces a conclusion
b)​ Conclusion produces knowledge of a certain high quality
(1)​Identifies the causes that bring about the conclusion
c)​ The science that follows from demonstration seeks to identify the
relations among fundamental principles that yield knowledge of
other things
B.​ Demonstration
1.​ A deduction that produces knowledge of a certain kind
a)​ Connects science with syllogism rather than the empirical method
2.​ A conclusion that is demonstrated is known by the person reflecting on
that demonstration

C.​ Two Important Aspects of Scientific Knowledge
1.​ Only that which is necessary can be known in this way
a)​ Expressed in the premises of the demonstration
(1)​Need to identify stable and deep properties of things
2.​ Scientific knowledge is the knowledge of causes
a)​ Knowledge is achieved when one comes to know through
demonstration
b)​ The premises of a proposition need to involve propositions which
are more familiar to us as to give rise to knowledge of the
conclusion which itself is less familiar
(1)​Demonstrations that proceed from cause to effect and from
effect to cause
3.​ Cause to effect
a)​ P1. Close heavenly bodies are nontwinkling heavenly bodies
P2. Planets are close heavenly bodies
C: Planets are non-twinkling heavenly bodies
b)​ The subject is the efficient cause of the premise
c)​ Start with something you know is true and figure out it’s natural
effect
(1)​Close heavenly bodies are non-twinkling
d)​ Conclusion provides causal explanation
(1)​Planets are non-twinkling heavenly bodies because they are
close
4.​ Effect to cause
a)​ Ex. P1. Nontwinkling heavenly bodies are close heavenly bodies
P2. Planets are nontwinkling heavenly bodies
C: Plants are close heavenly bodies
b)​ The premise is the effect of the subject
c)​ Start with something you have observed and figure out what
caused it
(1)​Non-twinkling heavenly bodies are close heavenly bodies
d)​ Conclusion does not provide a specific causal explanation
(1)​Planets are not necessarily close heavenly bodies because
they are non-twinkling
5.​ Presupposing Knowledge of Causes
a)​ The conclusion under the right relationship and epistemic
relationship to the premises will yield knowledge of the causes of
the conclusion
b)​ A given premise in a demonstration can be the conclusion of a
prior demonstration
(1)​Can work back to self-evident/fundamental premises
c)​ Demonstrations are ways of organizing a body of propositions
known to be true and the relation of causes that they have to each
other
d)​ This way which we gain knowledge is different from the way we
gain knowledge in science or rational reflection

(1)​Logic of discovery
e)​ Can learn of such causes without syllogisms through (I)scientific
experimentation and (II)abstracting universals from particulars
D.​ Unity
1.​ If a subject matter is a legitimate science, it must have a unified subject
matter that it studies
a)​ Must identify what it studies and the way in which it studies it
uniquely
(1)​Ex. Cannot study twigs and apple pie as the subject of a
science
2.​ A science is designated by providing a formal object
a)​ Formal object: The aspect under which it studies a wide variety of
things
b)​ Allows us to distinguish studies and terms in said studies
I.​

Aristotle
A.​ Student of Plato
B.​ Broad writings
1.​ Considered initiator of psychology, biology, logic, scientific methodology,
etc.
2.​ Wrote on literary theory, politics, ethics, physics, etc.
3.​ Only his lecture notes have survived
C.​ Differences between Plato and Aristotle
1.​ Raphael’s Fresco
a)​ Plato pointing up to the Heavens while Aristotle’s outstretched
hand is parallel to the ground
b)​ Bringing down the forms back to Earth
D.​ “The Philosopher”
1.​ His work signaled the apex of scientific thinking
Aristotle’s Metaphysics I
A.​ Aristotle on Wisdom and Experience
1.​ The wise person must find the ultimate and fundamental causes in
explanation of things
a)​ Knowing why something happens rather than knowing what
happens
2.​ Wisdom comes from reflection upon experience
B.​ Aristotle’s Criticism of the Philosophers
1.​ The previous philosophers do not identity the correct number and nature
of these principles to account for things
a)​ The natural philosophers tried to explain the full range of
phenomena by identifying a material cause and the interaction
among these things
2.​ A wise man must identify distinct principles in order to offer a complete
account of things
a)​ Must find explanations for the broadest range of experiences and
things

III.​

C.​ Aristotle’s Four Causes
1.​ The Material Cause: That from which a thing exists
a)​ Ex. Stone
2.​ The Formal Cause: Why something is of a certain cause or what
something is
a)​ Ex. Statue’s shape
3.​ The Efficient/Moving Cause: The cause of which a thing exists
a)​ Ex. The Sculptor
4.​ The Final Cause: Why something is good and that in which a thing’s
perfection resides
a)​ Ex. To be viewed/to represent someone/something
Aristotle’s Criticism of Plato
A.​ Aristotle’s View of Forms
1.​ Forms serve as principles of intelligibility to grasp stable and common
features of the world
a)​ Forms do breathe life into the world by being imminent to the
material world
(1)​Forms exist in a direct causal relationship with things by
being principles existing imminently in each thing that are
understood to be informed by them
(a)​ Immanent realism
(2)​If you remove forms from material things, forms can no
longer explain how things can be known to be true
(a)​ One cannot bypass perception without bypassing
any real knowledge of the perceived thing
B.​ Aristotle’s Criticism of Plato’s View of Forms
1.​ Incomplete and unable to offer a full account of explanation
a)​ Plato has only identified two of the four causes
(1)​Formal and material cause
b)​ Plato’s view is unable to identify the efficient and final cause
(1)​Efficient: Implies a copy is the cause of another copy
(a)​ Does not make sense in Plato’s model
(2)​Final: A copy cannot be the good which another thing is
inclined toward
(a)​ Ex. A goal of an animal is to eat food
2.​ Existence of Negative Forms Argument
a)​ Science studies opposites
b)​ There must be forms for both affirmation and negation
(1)​Not true of Plato’s view of forms
3.​ The Third Man Argument
a)​ All things are intelligible only because they participate in a form
existing in the realm of forms
b)​ All likenesses between two things are intelligible, thus X and Z are
said to be related in some form Y
c)​ Y is both like and unlike Z, so there must be some third thing in
virtue of which there is likeness between Y and Z(form YZ)

d)​ Form YZ is both like and unlike forms Y and Z
(1)​The cycle continues infinitely
I.​

Knowledge
A.​ “All human beings by nature desire to know”
1.​ All human beings seek to find answers to questions even though they have
forgotten what gave rise to the search in the first place
2.​ Man desires knowledge of things, even if they have no practical use
B.​ Degrees of Knowledge
1.​ Knowledge begins as memories of the past and recognition of patterns
through experience
a)​ May not show what works under all particular conditions
2.​ Thoroughness of knowledge comes with memory of causes
a)​ Transcends particular memories from particular experiences
3.​ The science for the most wise knows not only the causes but also the
fundamental causes of things
a)​ The wise person knows why something brings something about
Metaphysical Knowledge
A.​ The metaphysician has knowledge as far as possible without having it about each
particular thing
B.​ Metaphysics is the most universal science because it takes into consideration all
knowledge
1.​ It investigates the principles which give rise to all things known in various
other sciences
C.​ “The metaphysician is the one who is capable of knowing difficult things, that is
things not known by human beings and goes beyond mere sense perception.”
1.​ Despite dealing with less causes of things, the principles metaphysics deal
with are difficult to identify due to not being immediately perceivable
D.​ “The metaphysician is more exact and a better teacher of the causes.”
1.​ Metaphysics shines light on a wide variety of things through only a few
principles
2.​ The metaphysician has a comprehensive grasp of things in an integrated
and fundamental way
E.​ “Metaphysics is more worthy for the sake of knowing it.”
1.​ Although difficult to grasp, metaphysical principles are comprehensible in
themselves and give rise to all other things
F.​ “Metaphysics orders the other sciences”
1.​ Metaphysics has a controlling function to the other disciplines
2.​ Just because metaphysics has a controlling function to other disciplines, it
does not mean that all principles of those disciplines can be derived from
metaphysical principles directly
G.​ Metaphysics is a kind of divine knowledge
1.​ Transcends the human realm into the fundamental realm
2.​ Studies divine things themselves
Metaphysics is the Study of Being as Being

A.​ “There is a certain science which studies being as being and the attributes which
necessarily belong to being.”
1.​ Explanation of terms
a)​ “Being” Metaphysics investigates “being” as its stuff through
beings
b)​ “As being” Metaphysics investigates why a being is “as being”
c)​ Attributes of being
(1)​Being does not mean the same thing in each instance we
use it
(2)​Each sense makes reference to one controlling sense
(a)​ Substance is this controlling sense
d)​ Metaphysics is the science of substances
2.​ Metaphysics differs from other sciences
a)​ Metaphysics investigates all aspects of being rather than a
particular
b)​ The formal consideration in which metaphysics is investigated
differs from logic and theology
(1)​Metaphysics is the identification of the reality of being
itself
3.​ Investigation of the Topic
I.​

The Essence and Importance of Metaphysics
A.​ Metaphysics and Philosophy
1.​ Philosophy: The critically reflective systematically articulated attempt to
illuminate our human experience in depth and set it in vision of the whole
a)​ Symmington provides an example making sense of the human
experience through observations of the external and reflections of
the internal
(1)​Must find fundamental principles that make human beings
what they are through critical reflection and systemization
of our beliefs about human nature and fit it in the context of
the whole
(a)​ Critical reflection: Subject a belief to scrutiny
through arguments in support of and argument
against a particular belief being true
b)​ Philosophy begins with a broad collective human experience
(1)​Symmington provides an example of the collective
experience of time consciousness(present, past, future)
2.​ Metaphysics: The study of being as being, which seeks to discover the
basic attributes common to all beings, and establish the ultimate laws,
principles, and causes of being itself
a)​ Father Clarke adds “ultimate laws, principles, and causes of being
itself” to Aristotle’s definition to have both a broad understanding
of being and ultimate understanding of being(ultimate source,
cause, being in most preeminent way)

II.​

(1)​Symmington references the two parts of metaphysics(see
Science of Metaphysics notes)
b)​ Metaphysics connects back to the definition of philosophy by
being critically reflective of what is being and a systematic
articulation through a coherent system of beliefs
(1)​Human experience is the content which metaphysics
studies
(a)​ Symmington connects this with faith and divine
revelation
The Principles and Methodology of Metaphysics
A.​ Principles
1.​ All being is inherently intelligible(can be understood)
a)​ Truth can be obtained about every being
(1)​Symmington provides a black hole example
b)​ Counter: “Only a part of being is intelligible, some parts are
fundamentally unintelligible”
(1)​Can only understand as it relates to our survival
(2)​Refute: Man has already come to understand principles,
such as mathematics, that go beyond our environment or
sense experience
(a)​ Further, the point is paradoxical and collapses on
itself, for the statement is not provable by sense
experience
(b)​Man also has a drive to know that is greater than his
drive to survive
2.​ Metaphysics makes us humble to truth to always know that human beings
as such are deficient in their understanding of truth
a)​ Allows us to constantly grow in our intellect
3.​ Metaphysics draws on resources of natural reason alone as applied to our
common human experience
a)​ All concepts are derived in human experience
4.​ Principle of Non-Contradiction: Nothing can be and not be at the same
time under the same aspect
a)​ Something cannot exist and not exist
b)​ Therefore, no proposition or statement can be both asserted and
denied at the same time and under the same aspect
(1)​Symmington provides an example that a figure cannot be
triangle and square
5.​ Principle of Sufficient Reason: Every being has the sufficient reason for its
existence either in itself or in another
a)​ Has to be a sufficient reason for the existence of each particular
object
6.​ Metaphysics proceeds from things more recognizable to our understanding
and experience to things less recognizable
a)​ Begin with the common things and proceed from those concepts

(1)​Symmington provides an example of material substance to
immaterial substance
I.​

II.​

Understanding Being
A.​ We are already familiarized with “being”
1.​ We use “being” in our everyday sentences as the copula
a)​ Copula connects subject and predicate
b)​ Ex. Emily is happy
B.​ Being: “That which is”
1.​ Expressed two components of being
a)​ It is an individual something of a specific sort under a certain
concept
(1)​“That which”
b)​ The notion of existence
(1)​“Is”
C.​ Developing an Awareness of Being
1.​ Considering a particular thing and removing its properties until it is just
sheer existence
a)​ Symmington provides an example of a desk without particular
color, size, shape, etc.
2.​ Consider everything that is, regardless of its designation, and find what is
common among all those things
a)​ What is common is that they all exist
3.​ The principle of a being is a separate principle from the principles by
which it is an individual, and by which it is a thing of a certain kind, as
well as all the accidental features an object possesses
4.​ Being as a proposition
a)​ Asserting a proposition gets at the notion of what existence is
(1)​Ex. Emily is happy
(a)​ You consider Emily’s happiness as being real
5.​ Existence/being is the feature of all things
D.​ Two types of being: mental being and real being
Real Being and Mental Being
A.​ Real being: That which is present by its own extrinsic act of existence outside of
an idea
1.​ Act on its own without being dependent on another thing
B.​ Mental being: That which is present, not by its own act of existence, but within an
idea
1.​ Dependent on a real being
C.​ Projection of real being onto mental being
1.​ Symmington provides an example of a 10 dollar bill and how one projects
a mental value upon real paper
a)​ Symmington provides other examples of art, law, flags, etc.
D.​ Fundamental division of real being
1.​ Substances and Accidents
a)​ Substances: That which exists not in anything else

b)​ Accidents: That which exist adhering in substances
(1)​Accidents have a dependent nature on substances, not vice
versa
c)​ The Nine Accidents of Real Being
(1)​According to the Aristotelian system: quality, quantity,
relation, position, time, place, action, passion, habit
E.​ How does one know there is such a thing as real beings?
1.​ Some, like non-realists and relativists, reduce real being to just a function
of the mind
a)​ Challenge 1: There is no such thing as the material world, only the
mental world
(1)​Bishop Berkely asserts all we are aware of are the
perceptions we have
b)​ Challenge 2: There is no way to distinguish between mental and
real beings
(1)​We cannot know real beings apart from the conditioning of
our experiences
c)​ Response to Challenge 2: We can distinguish real being from
mental being by action
(1)​Real beings act on their own, express themselves in action,
and are the center and source of their own characteristic
action
(a)​ We act upon others and they act upon us outside of
our control
(2)​Symmington provides a thought experiment of a being with
no action at all
(a)​ Asserts that because it could neither act on others or
be acted upon, it is equivalent to a non-being
(b)​Through principle of noncontradiction, we know a
being cannot be equivalent to a non being
(3)​Being is not identical with action, but it is a necessary
property of being
d)​ Response to Challenge 1: Can observe the dynamic interpersonal
dialogue
(1)​Impossible to interact with others without sense of
interpersonality
(2)​Aristotle proposes that the possibility of there being another
being lends itself to it being true given the evidence
I.​
II.​

Being
A.​ Broad and far ranging
1.​ We often mean different things when we employ the word “being”
The Doctrine of Analogy
A.​ Context of Analogy
1.​ Similar to logic

a)​ Both discuss terms, propositions, their relationship, and view them
in a comparative way to show the meaning structure
2.​ Fundamentally, analogy has to do with meaning
a)​ The relation of different terms to another to provide different
meaning of the terms that yield analogous meaning to those terms
3.​ Think about two propositions and the predicate’s relation to them
B.​ Univocal vs Equivocal
1.​ Univocal Naming
a)​ The meaning of the predicate is exactly the same in each
proposition comparatively
(1)​Ex. “Donkey is an animal” and “Socrates is an animal”
(a)​ “Animal” has the same meaning in each proposition
2.​ Equivocal Naming
a)​ Fundamental difference between the terms in the predicate
(1)​Ex. “The author writes with a pen” and “The pig lives in a
pen”
(a)​ “Pen” has different meaning in each proposition
C.​ Analogy’s Purpose
1.​ Similar to both univocal and equivocal
a)​ The meaning of the two predicates share similarities and
differences that are not reductive through a process of abstraction
(1)​Ex. “The man is strong” and “The argument is strong”
(a)​ Similar meanings, but not the exact same meaning
2.​ Necessary for understanding the principles of being in metaphysics
a)​ Does not lose the overall unity of a concept
b)​ Does not assert being is a univocal concept that stands apart from
the things it captures
(1)​Similarity without being fundamentally univocal
c)​ Integrates being so that the predicate of being is predicated
D.​ Types of Analogy
1.​ Extrinsic Attribution
a)​ One primary meaning associated with the analogous term and
other meanings are derived from the primary analogate
(1)​Extrinsic relation outside of the derivative meanings of the
terms and gain relation to the term by being casually related
to the primary analogate
(a)​ I.e. The use of an analogous word derives its
meaning from one primary meaning of the word
(2)​Ex. “Socrates is healthy” and “Socrates’ food is healthy”
(a)​ The second sentence’s “healthy” is not actually
healthy(food is dead), but healthy in relation to its
impact on Socrates’ health
2.​ Analogy of Proportionality
a)​ Intrinsic type of analogy
b)​ Proper possession of the analogous meaning in the predicate by the
thing expressed in the subject of that proposition

c)​ Term is predicated of several subjects in order to demonstrate a
proportional similarity between the subjects
(1)​Ex. “The fox knows” and “The man knows”
(a)​ There is an intrinsic relationship between man and
fox in both of their “knowing”
(b)​Yet they both “know” differently
d)​ The similarities are captured in the context of activities associated
with the subjects
e)​ Symington provides an analogy of a ratio if needing further
explanation(17:10 in the video)
3.​ Analogy of Proper Proportionality
a)​ Rules out metaphorical predications
(1)​Ex. “God is a rock” and “the stone is a rock”
(a)​ God is only a rock in a metaphorical sense, a stone
is a rock in the literal sense
(2)​Able to predicate differences in meaning in a sense that is
literally true
(3)​Cannot abstract similar common notion as you can with
univocal concepts
(a)​ “Both Socrates and donkey are animals”
(i)​ Thinking about animal in an abstract way
(ii)​ Not about “how” or their relation to each
other
(b)​“Both man and the fox know”
(i)​ Cannot think about knowledge in an abstract
way
(ii)​ Think about knowledge in relation to the
subject
(4)​Ex. “Substance is a being” and “accidents are being”
(a)​ Both refer to their existence rather than their mode
of being
I.​

Unity as Transcendental Property of Being
A.​ Metaphysics studies not only being as being, but also the necessary properties of
being
1.​ Unity is a necessary property of being
2.​ One can study the properties of being since the central meaning of being is
in relation to substance
a)​ We can understand other things in relation to the central meaning
of existence
B.​ Unity as a Transcendental
1.​ Unity is a property of substantial being equivalent to substantial existence
itself
a)​ Not a property of being in a secondary sense, but as fundamental
and central as existence itself
2.​ Unity is convertible with being itself

II.​

a)​ Every substantially existing thing has substantial unity, and
everything with substantial unity is a substantially existing thing
3.​ Being and Unity are extensionally identical but intentionally distinct
4.​ Unity is a property of being because the concept through which we
understood unity is different from the concept through which we
understood being
5.​ Unity is the same thing as being, just understood differently
a)​ Ex. “Socrates is a rational animal” and “Socrates is a featherless
biped”
(1)​Different intentions, same extension
C.​ Unity and Existence
1.​ Unity is an understanding of being insofar as it is an undivided whole
a)​ To be real is to be one and unified, so anything that exists must be
understood as one
2.​ Can anything exist and have no unity?
a)​ Symington provides an example of how “X” exists, not as a whole,
but as a sum of parts(A, B, C)
b)​ Each part must also be a sum of parts
c)​ This goes infinitely into incomprehension
d)​ At some level, an entity must exist that is composed of parts(rather
than the sum of parts)
3.​ Unity and Real Beings
a)​ As noted, Being and Unity are extensionally identical but
intentionally distinct
(1)​If one identifies an object as being, it is also understood as
“one”
(a)​ Both correspond with each other
(2)​How is this possible?
(a)​ A thing that properly exists is a being
(b)​A being is a thing with an essence of both matter
and form
(i)​ The essence gives the ability of a thing to be
understood in a universal way
(c)​ Existence is focused on the essence, and the
material essence is focused on the individual
(d)​Being an individual of a certain kind results in
being one
(i)​ Being “one” is unified and particular
4.​ Unity and Mental Beings
a)​ The unity of essence in a mind is a universal
(1)​Unity by which many individuals can be understood by a
common kind or concept
(2)​The potency of the essence existing in the intellect is
actualized and takes on a different existential realization
than that of real being
Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Unity

A.​ Some things that seem to have intrinsic unity(and therefore being) but do not
1.​ Ex. A beehive does not have intrinsic unity, despite the unity to the
activity of the beehive
B.​ Some things seem to exist but lack unity
1.​ Ex. A water puddle has no distinct parts that are different but relate as a
whole to compose it
C.​ Do we distinguish things that have actual unity vs having the appearance of unity?
1.​ Distinguishing the two relates on two factors
a)​ Assessment of the unified action/activity associated with the
substantial essences
(1)​The focal meaning of essence is human beings(a unified
being)
(a)​ Can examine human beings to see the wide ranging
operations that are indicative of a unified being
(b)​Ex. Animals and plants have intrinsic unity, as they
naturally do things like humans
(c)​ A diamond has some intrinsic being due to the
inability to put together its parts and remake that
being as it was
(i)​ Artifacts can do this, and thus have extrinsic
being(are the sum of parts)
b)​ If a thing is made up of beings with intrinsic unity, the
interrelations among those things cannot yield another being with
intrinsic unity
(1)​I am confused on this part. Ask Dr. Symington about it later
D.​ What is the metaphysics of intrinsic unity opposed to extrinsic unity?
1.​ A thing with substantial essence will be a thing with intrinsic unity
a)​ Artifacts do not have substantial essences, but an accidental unity
of substances that make them up
I.​

II.​

The Problem of Universals
A.​ Problem: How can things exist both as one and be individuals
1.​ One: Classed or qualified according to a certain kind
2.​ Individuals: Separated from every other individual
3.​ Unity vs Particulars
a)​ Ex. Plato and Socrates are both human, yet are individuals
4.​ Form and Matter
a)​ Form: What is common among individuals
b)​ Matter: The individuality of a thing
Form and Matter
A.​ Form: That in a being which makes it to be this kind of being and not some other
1.​ What is common among individuals
2.​ Principle of similarity/likeness between X and Y
a)​ Principle of likeness: X and Y have the same nature
b)​ Not the same as universals

(1)​Universals are concepts by which we understand distinct
individuals
(2)​Forms are things existing really in individual objects,
which are the foundation by which we really understand
different things according to universal concepts
c)​ The principle of the distinctive identity of a thing at the level of it
being a unitary being
(1)​A form makes a cat a cat in virtue of its catness
d)​ Principle of intelligibility- Can abstract the form from the
particular to understand it in a universal way
B.​ Matter:
1.​ The individuality of a being
a)​ Makes distinct being
b)​ Principle of individualization: That by which a thing is an
individual or a “this”
2.​ Principle of dissimilarity between X and Y at the level of essence, by
which it is an individual thing
3.​ Distinguishes X and Y from each other without introducing any additional
qualitative matter between them
a)​ There is something each thing has on its own without sharing it in
any way
(1)​Converse Principle of the Identity of Indiscernables: If
there are two things that have identical properties, it must
be the same thing
(2)​Symington provides an example sphere land
(a)​ Everything that is said of sphere A can be said of
sphere B
(b)​Even though they are identical in form and
universals, there are still individually separate
spheres due to the principle of dissimilarity(matter)
b)​ Saying something qualitative that is identified with an individual is
not sufficient to fully individiduate two objects from each other
(1)​Anything that is a qualitative difference can be understood
in a universal way
(2)​Anything understood in a universal way can be
characterized due to common notion
(3)​Two objects are differentiated as individuals because they
do not have a common notion
4.​ Cannot be abstracted in an intelligible way
a)​ Prime matter cannot be abstracted because it involves separating
off in a universal way
C.​ Two Senses of Matter:
1.​ Prime matter: That which has pure potentiality
a)​ Inherently formless and can be informed in different ways
(1)​Fundamentally plastic in nature

2.​ Matter: Any lower component(of potentiality) element in a complex
material thing
a)​ Ex. Human being is a rational animal
(1)​Rational - Form, Animal - Matter
b)​ It is what it is because of its determination to the essential form of
a being
D.​ Form and matter answer how X and Y are both individuals but share the same
nature/equal standing/common kind
1.​ Form and matter are two irreducible principles involved in a real
composition in beings beyond the constitution of the act of existence with
essence
a)​ Must account for principle of individuality and unity of kinds
(1)​Plato and Socrates share a unity in their human nature
(2)​Plato and Socrates have distinct matter as individuals
E.​ Being is that which is
1.​ Essence is “that which”
2.​ There is a distinction in essences between form and matter
a)​ Form and matter(essence), and existence make up the composition
of an existing thing
3.​ In every essence, there is something that makes it a what and the thing
which makes it to be a this, that
a)​ “What”: A thing of a certain kind
(1)​Form account for the “what”
(2)​Ex. Humanity
(3)​Determining Principle: That which determines it to be a
certain kind
(4)​We abstract from the “what” when we think of individuals
through universal concepts
b)​ “This or that”: A particular
(1)​Matter accounts for the particular
(2)​Ex. Socrates
F.​ Must account for form and matter in a thing
1.​ Necessity for form
a)​ Without form, we fall into nominalism, and ultimately skepticism
and relativism in unreliable concepts of the world
b)​ Form allows us to think of counterfactual scenarios
(1)​“What if” scenarios that allow for other properties given
from a thing, given that it exists
(2)​Symington provides an example of a hypothetical planet in
the solar system having necessary certain properties
I.​

One and Many
A.​ Problem: How can there be individual existing things that are all distinct from
each other and a common existence property that is shared in common?
1.​ Possible Response: The problem cannot be answered, being is either one
and not many, or many and not one.

a)​ Monism: There is only one, not many - No diversity, only unity
(1)​The only thing that exists is the individual one, plurality is
an illusion
(a)​ P1. If X is being and Y is being, and X is not the
same thing as Y, then X must be other than being
P2. The only thing other than being is
nothing, so X must be nothing
P3. But Y is not nothing, but is being
C: Therefore X and Y are on in the same
(i)​ May be similar to say if X=Z and Y=Z, X
must also equal Y. If X did not equal Y, X
would not equal Z.
(b)​There is no distinct objects that exist, merely
common existence
(2)​Problem: P1. If plurality is an illusion, myself, as the
subject of the illusion, does not exist as the subject of the
illusion
P2. I know I exist as the subject of the illusion
C: Plurality is not an illusion and many things exist
(a)​ Simplified: I have the appearance as part of the
many rather than one, which is an illusion. But I
must first exist to have an illusion. If I am having an
illusion, there is a distinction between myself and
the illusion. Therefore plurality in being
b)​ Pluralism: There is only many, not one - No unity, only diversity
(1)​No unifying bond among distinct thing
(a)​ Unifying terms like being are mental abstractions
invented by us for our convenience
(2)​Connected with the view of empiricism
(a)​ Empiricism: Only can really know things through
sensible experience
(3)​Problem: Existence is not reducible to an essence or mode
of being(a “what”), nor a mere static state(something we
do), but is a dynamic act of presence that makes any
essence or nature real
(a)​ Symington references proofs for being from a
previous lecture
(b)​Symington provides an example of a possible vs
actual world, and how the only difference is one
does not exist
2.​ Possible Response: Being is one and many through the participation of
existence through limiting essence
a)​ What is participation?
(1)​Participation is a relation between the pattern(or model of
something) and some other thing

(a)​ The pattern and the part that participates in the
pattern
(b)​When X participates in Y, X is not Y, but X is what
it is because it resembles/is fundamentally ordered
to Y
(c)​ Y is external to X, yet X has essential determination
through Y
(2)​Something exists because it has existence from a common
source(God)
(a)​ Existence is the participation in the existence of
pure existence
(3)​Limited by its essence to a certain kind
b)​ Every real being is constituted by a complimentary polarity of two
metaphysical principles: an active existence(it actually exists) and
a limiting essence(participates in a particular manner)
c)​ Is the only thing that really exists pure existence?
(1)​No, while each thing participates in the act of existence,
each thing has its own existence
(a)​ Not possible for essence
(2)​A desk exists through participation in pure existence, yet by
its participation, it gains its own existence
(a)​ X participates in Y, and Y exists. X is not identical
with Y. Therefore X also exists in itself without
being Y, but does not exist to the degree of Y
(3)​X cannot be the same existence as Y
(a)​ God is defined as pure existence and a desk is
defined as limited existence, therefore a desk cannot
be God
B.​ The Principles of Real Being
1.​ Metaphysical Coprinciples: Principles of similarity and difference
a)​ X and Y are similar in both being real, and dissimilar in being
different beings
b)​ If there were not two opposite attributes, there would not be
similarity and difference
(1)​Symington provides an example of another thing being
John Smith if John Smith and the other thing lacked no
differences
(2)​Clarkes provides an example of A, A/B, A/C, A/D
c)​ The coprinciples are incomplete in themselves in being a principle
of real being, but together make up one real being
(1)​Need each other in order to exist as a real being
2.​ Act of Existence is positive principle, Act of Essence is negative principle
a)​ Essence is not a positive principle in relation to existence
(1)​If it was, it would be as if something beyond being was
added to being

(a)​ This is illogical because nothing can be added to
being
(2)​Existence is a maximum, essences limit the maximum
(a)​ Essence is a partial negation/boundary to the
fullness of being
(3)​Being is common in its participation in existence, but many
in essences

Becoming vs Being
A.​ The form is understood as a stable, unchanging thing
1.​ Its existence is held in a stable way
B.​ Change is the process that occurs between these stable moments in being
1.​ Some philosophers have denied this existence of change
a)​ Argue change is impossible because being is fundamentally
understood with what is fundamentally stable, unchanging, and
intelligible
2.​ Must look at how the notion of becoming can fit into a larger metaphysical
structure
Non-Thomistic Accounts of Change That Deny Stability
A.​ Heraclitus and Charle Darwin
1.​ Argues that the essence of all things is flux
a)​ The fundamental reality of existence is that things constantly
change
b)​ “You never bathe in the same river twice” - Heraclitus
(1)​It means that stability is an illusion
2.​ Darwin holds that there is no unchanging essence to an organism
a)​ An organism is simply a snapshot in a particular moment in time
B.​ Empiricist Philosopher David Hume
1.​ Argues that something permanent remains through change is an illusion
a)​ All human beings are aware of is an influx of images and ideas
with no overarching principle common to that change
(1)​The human being itself is just a bundle of these images
(a)​ Ex. A child has a combination of radically changing
ideas
C.​ Henri Burgson
1.​ Argues that reality itself is the continuous flow of becoming
a)​ We try to master the flux by freezing it into immobile snapshots
(1)​Try to account for the fundamental flow of time through
these immobile snapshots
(2)​Leads to falsifying reality itself
2.​ Argues that subjectivity is the frozen notion of concepts
a)​ Ex. A baseball player throwing a baseball
(1)​Breaking it down by the steps vs the lived experience
(a)​ The lived experience is real, the breaking down is
subjectivity
Act and Potency

A.​ Unified account of change
B.​ Change
1.​ Change: The transition from one real mode of being to another
a)​ Ex. A real person who is asleep is the same person who is awake
2.​ Every being undergoing real change must have two principles related to
each other as act and potency
3.​ Every change involves a process by which something is other than what it
was in some respect
a)​ If an object is not different, no change occurred
4.​ Each change involves going from one mode of actuality as a prior terminal
mode to a different actuality as a subsequent terminal mode
a)​ The bookends of change are where change begins and where it
terminates
5.​ A third principle must be involved in change in order to go from this
starting state to ending state
a)​ If going from X to Y, there must be something that somehow
remains throughout the change
C.​ Principle of Continuity: That which undergoes the change from this state to that
state
1.​ Only way to understand that Y was X, and that X has become Y
2.​ Referencing the earlier example, if the principle is denied, the person that
was asleep cannot be described as the same person who is awake
3.​ The principle of continuity is a thing’s potentiality
D.​ Actuality and Potentiality
1.​ Potentiality: A thing’s radical capacity for receiving a new mode of being
that didn’t previously exist
a)​ Symington provides an example of a cat’s potential to become a
corpse
b)​ Symington references a previous lecture of matter’s radical
potency to take on a wide variety of forms
2.​ Two types of potency:
a)​ Passive Potency: The potentiality to receive some determination
from without
(1)​Ex. Socrates has the passive potency to get a sun tan
(a)​ Socrates is effected by the external
b)​ Active Potency: The capacity which a thing possesses to act from
within
(1)​Is not being actualized in a particular moment, but has the
potency to change from within the object
(2)​Ex. Socrates has an active potency to throw a baseball
(a)​ Socrates is effected by the internal
I.​

Substance and Accidents
A.​ Substance
1.​ Substances change with respect to the accidents they possess

2.​ Aristotle described a substance as the focal meaning of being which
fundamentally exists in the order of being
a)​ Substance is what we mean by a thing having existence
b)​ Everything else is understood in relationship to substance
3.​ Substances have the most fundamental existence and identity conditions
B.​ Accidents: Ways in which substances are determined in an incidental or qualified
way
1.​ Accidents are understood in relation to substance
a)​ A substance can exist without a particular accident
(1)​A particular accident cannot exist without a particular
substance in which it adheres
2.​ Symington references the ten qualities of being in a previous lecture and
describes accidents as the qualifications of substance that are determined
by the nine categories
a)​ They are modification/modalities of substance
3.​ Accidents are real modes of being
a)​ They are entities, but special types of entities that exist in a
substance
b)​ Symington provides an example of Socrates as a substantial being
and his skin color as an accidental being
(1)​There is a relationship between the real mode of being as
existing within the substance
C.​ Accidental Change
1.​ Transition from one real mode of being to another where the self-identity
of a thing remains intact
a)​ The change which occurs is not strong enough to change the
identity of the thing
2.​ An accidental change causes the substance to change in such a way that it
is one and the same substance that remains
a)​ Must thing of accidental change as something that happens to the
substance with respect to its accidental modalities
(1)​The substance changes in a non-substantial/essential way
b)​ When accidents change in a substance, the substance does change,
as it changes one of its modes
D.​ Substance Identity Conditions
1.​ Substance should be thought of as the unifying center of the many
different attributes and properties possessed by one being at any one time
simultaneously
a)​ Substance possesses, in a unified way, a potency to be expressed in
many non-essential ways
2.​ Primary source of the unity of a being
3.​ A substance is active and can be understood as the dynamic way through
which a thing and its various changes are controlled or ordered so as to
reflect the unity and being of the substance itself
a)​ Ex. A human being will go through many changes that are
appropriate for its certain kind

(1)​Ex. Growth from child to adult
b)​ There are “inappropriate changes” which a substance cannot
undergo in order to remain the same thing
c)​ A substance is determinative of the accidents
(1)​The accidents adhere to the substance and are ordered by it
E.​ Substance Existence Conditions
1.​ A substance is that which is apt to exist in itself and not in another
a)​ Whereas accidents are understood as that which exist in another
(1)​They do not have their own being, but obtain being through
the being of the substance in which it adheres
F.​ Substance vs Accidents
1.​ Substance are understood to possess active existence
a)​ Fundamentally identified with existence
2.​ Accidents are a further determination or limitation of the being of the
substance such that it borrows the substantial being of the substance to
give it a non-essential or derivative being in its own right
a)​ Ex. Socrates’ skin color is an entity that exists as a modification of
the being of the substance of Socrates
(1)​Rather than existing on its own right
b)​ Accidents are not “to exist” but “to exist in”
G.​ Mental Being vs Substantial Being vs Accidental Being
1.​ Symington illustrates the differences by way of examples
a)​ Socrates himself is a primary subsatnce
(1)​A primary substance is an individually existing thing
(a)​ Not a universal
(2)​Such a being is not an accident(does not exist in another)
and not a universal(not predicated or said of another thing)
b)​ Socrates has particular paleness
(1)​The paleness of Socrates’ skin does exist in another, but it
is a particular rather than a universal
(2)​Aristotle refers to the paleness of Socrates’ skin as a
primary accident
(a)​ It’s individual, so its a real being rather than a
universal
(b)​Its an accident because it exists in another
c)​ Socrates is a human
(1)​Humanity is a universal - its predicated of Socrates, Plato,
etc
(2)​“It is said of another but does not exist in another”
(a)​ Humanity is a universal form of a substance
d)​ The paleness of Socrates’ skin
(1)​A secondary accident
(2)​Universal paleness - can be predicated of more than one
individual
(a)​ Is derivative in that it expresses an accident
(3)​Must always think of “paleness” in relation to another thing
