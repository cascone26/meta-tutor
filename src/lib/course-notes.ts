You can go ghost hunting without knowing precisely what a ghost is\nB.​ We just need impressions surrounding the word to start an investigation over the\nsubject\n1.​ We already have a level of familiarity with what the word “metaphysics”\nis as we have a level of familiarity with what a “ghost” is\n2.​ Our impressions are accompanied with various actions that we associate\nwith a word\na)​ Ex. Metaphysics is associated abstract, impractical, and\nnonscientific\n3.​ We can use the impressions of metaphysics to begin to address whether or\nnot it is important\na)​ Ex. against metaphysics being valuable:\nP1. All purely abstract pursuits are unimportant\nP2. Metaphysics is a purely abstract pursuit\nC: Therefore metaphysics is unimportant\nArguments against the value of metaphysics\nA.​ Metaphysics may not be valuable because it is difficult to “do” or properly\nunderstand\n1.​ Counter: One’s ability to do a thing does not give a thing importance\na)​ Ex. Math is important regardless of whether or not one can do it\n2.​ Metaphysics may not be valuable because it cannot contribute to progress\nlike science does\na)​ Metaphysical views may be unable to be established as true or\nfalse or are neither true or false\n(1)​Counter: A belief can be true while not having a way of\ndetermining its truth\nB.​ Metaphysics may be too abstract and removed from real and practical things\nC.​ Metaphysics may be too cold, rationalistic, and impersonal\n1.​ There is only real value in community, empathy, and warmth which\nmetaphysics does not provide\nResponse to the arguments against the value of metaphysics\nA.​ Is metaphysics unimportant because it cannot be settled or subjected to scientific\nexamination?\n1.​ Metaphysics provides consistency of language and concepts of\nunderstanding the full realm of human experience\na)​ Arguably functions as higher end scientific theory\nb)​ Metaphysical theories are ordered like scientific theories as they\nare both falsifiable\n(1)​Metaphysical theories tend to be more general than\nscientific theories\n2.​ Metaphysics attempts to fundamentally and rationally understand the order\nof things ranging from broad perspective to everyday experiences\n\n\f3.​ Hume’s claim that value comes from quantifiability or experimental/\nscientific methodology is a contradiction\na)​ Humen’s claim on human understanding uses neither, thereby\nmaking his claims useless by his own standards\n4.​ Hume’s view leads to absurd consequences\na)​ Not all facts are known by the scientific method\nB.​ Is metaphysics useless because it is too abstract and impractical?\n1.​ The claim of “all abstract things are unimportant” is not true\na)​ Ex. higher mathematics are abstract yet important\nb)​ Rational pursuits have intrinsic and not just practical value\nc)​ There are two notions of abstract\n(1)​Abstraction is being positively removed from reality\n(a)​ Unhelpful view that one can be rightly critical of\n(2)​Abstraction is thinking of something independently from\nsaid thing being real\n(a)​ Helps us to begin to understand parts of reality we\nhave no experienced but are metaphysically\npossible\n2.​ The claim of “metaphysics is impractical” is not true\na)​ Our theoretical commitments direct our behavior even without\npursuing theoretical questions for purely practical reasons\nb)​ Metaphysical world views are inescapable\n(1)​We often express metaphysical judgements about the world\nin our daily interactions and worldviews\nC.​ Is metaphysics unimportant because it is isolating and is unfeeling?\n1.​ We should integrate our empathetic, practical, and social interests with\nmetaphysical points of view\na)​ Ex. Slaves and masters in American history being a metaphysical\nperspective that forgot empathy\nII.​\nI.​\n\nDefinitions\nA.​ A definition is the meaning of something, not what something is\n1.​ Ex: A circle is a figure, but a figure is not a circle\na)​ Socrates seeks to find what is the same among many different\nthings\n(1)​Ex: A figure is the limits of a surface\nB.​ Intentional vs Extensional Definition\n1.​ Intentional definition: That thing which all things called virtuous have in\ncommon\n2.​ Extensional definition: List of things with a common nature\n3.​ The importance of definition is that it aids us in taking hold of a thing in a\nway that prevents us from slipping away from our mental grasp of it\na)​ Extensional definitions leave room for misapplication of names in\ncertain circumstances\n\n\fII.​\n\nIII.​\n\nI.​\n\nb)​ Understanding the true application of terms to all things which\nthey apply results in progress toward truth in judgements\nC.​ Techniques in which intentional definitions are obtained\n1.​ Definitions by way of genus and specific difference\na)​ Begin with broad concept and narrow it to fit only things in which\nthe term applies\nb)​ The necessary and sufficient conditions for the true application of a\nterm\n(1)​Find what is true of the correct application of a thing\n(2)​The term will contain features that are not true of other\nthings which are termed\n(a)​ Find necessary and sufficient conditions to narrow\nContradiction and Counter Example\nA.​ Socrates often won an argument by leading his opponent to contradict himself or\nadmit other beliefs that are contrary to the original claim\n1.​ Assert a claim as true but realize in the argument that they believe the\nopposite\na)​ Ex. Socrates vs Theaetetus on knowledge\nB.​ Counter example plays an important role in metaphysics\n1.​ To disprove universal claims that all S is/is not P, demonstrate a case\nwhere some S is not/is P\n2.​ It is possible to refute particular claims such as some S is P\nSocrates as midwife for truth\nA.​ Justification: Rational support or evidence for thinking that a particular belief is\ntrue\n1.​ We must seek reasons for believing in the things we believe\nB.​ The role of the philosopher is to help people give birth to truth\n1.​ Suggests we all have an internal relationship to the truth\n2.​ Must build on prior knowledge and apply reasoning to discover new truths\nC.​ Socrates believes the job of reason is to aid us in remembering again what we\nhave forgotten\nPlato’s divided line\nD.​ The world of appearances\n1.​ Visible Realm\na)​ The closer you are to the visible realm, the further you are from the\ntruth and reality\nb)​ Two sections:\n(1)​The state of illusion(eikasia)\n(a)​ The state in which images exist\n(i)​ The furthest state from truth\n(ii)​ State of shadows and reflections\n(iii)​ Tree example\n(a)​ You are looking at the shadow of the\ntree rather than the actual tree\n\n\f(b)​Shadows can change forms and are a\nvague image of the real thing\n(2)​ The state of belief(pistis)\n(a)​ The state in which objects exist\n(i)​ Second furthest state from the truth\n(ii)​ State of animals and man made items\n(iii)​ State in which we use our senses\n(a)​ Plato does not believe we can get\nknowledge from our senses\n(3)​The states of illusion and belief result in opinion(doxa)\nE.​ The world of the forms\n1.​ Intelligible Realm\na)​ The closer you got to the intelligible realm, the closer you got to\ntruth and reality\nb)​ Two sections:\n(1)​The state of mathematical reasoning(dianola)\n(a)​ Second closest state to truth\n(b)​The state in which some ideas exist\n(i)​ Mathematical forms and geometry\n(c)​ Plato believes math is one of the closest things to\nmath we can get in our world\n(i)​ Perfect straight line/perfect triangle\n(a)​ Ideas we can conjure from math that\nare impossible for us to achieve in\nthe material world\n(2)​The state of intelligence(noesis)\n(a)​ Closest state to truth\n(b)​The state in which pure ideas exist\n(i)​ Forms(eidos) and philosophy\n(c)​ We can access the forms through minds\n(3)​The states of mathematical reasoning and intelligence result\nin knowledge(episteme)\nI.​\n\nII.​\n\nMethodology\nA.​ Nothing characterizes a philosopher’s work more than the methodology they\nemploy\nB.​ Methodology is important to both philosophy and science\nSaving the Appearances\nA.​ Verifying common beliefs by means of observing the natural world(appearances)\nto uphold said common beliefs\n1.​ Employs this methodology in both metaphysics and ethics and against\nother philosophers\nB.​ Employing syllogistic reasoning to determine whether or not a philosophy is\ncontrary to a known conclusion\nC.​ Man comes to know the truth by objects given through experience\n\n\fIII.​\n\n1.​ Aristotle believes perception is the means through which all knowledge is\nattained\na)​ Our concepts and starting point for all knowledge(including\ndistinct truths) is through and in perceptual experience\nb)​ Perception is potentially intelligible\n2.​ Aristotle recognizes man makes his own conclusions from basically the\nsame common pool of experience\nD.​ One must carefully weigh reasons for various views and find a view that makes\nthe most sense of our human experience\n1.​ Convince others through this why their philosophy is erroneous\na)​ Ex. Eliminativism\n​\nP1. All things that really exist are things that can be\nunderstood in principle through empirical science\n​\nP2. No minds and individual consciousnesses are things\nthat can be understood in principle through empirical science\n​\nC. No minds and individual consciousnesses are things that\nreally exist\n(1)​Aristotle would hold that the conclusion is false because it\nfails to save the appearances of consciousness and\nmindedness\n(a)​ One can easily observe their consciousness and\nthere are things which are beyond what can be\ndemonstrated by empirical science\nSyllogistic Reasoning\nA.​ Every belief is true or false\n1.​ This applies even if we doubt if it is true or false\nB.​ Every basic belief has three component\n1.​ Subject\na)​ What the belief is about\nb)​ Socrates is philosophical\n2.​ Copula\na)​ Expresses that the predicate can be understood to be true of the\nsubject\nb)​ Socrates is philosophical\n(1)​Expresses that being philosophical is actually true of\nSocrates\n3.​ Predicate\na)​ Expresses a property or an attribute\nb)​ Has universal features\nc)​ Socrates is philosophical\n(1)​Philosophical expresses the property of being philosophical\nC.​ Quantity and Quality\n1.​ Quantity regards the subject and quality regards the predicate\n2.​ Quantity: Three kinds\na)​ Universal\n(1)​Indicated by the term all\n\n\fb)​ Particular\n(1)​Indicated by the term some\nc)​ Singular\n(1)​Indicated by a proper name\n3.​ Quality\na)​ Whether the predicate is affirmative or negative\n(1)​Negativity is indicated by the words not or no\nD.​ Four kinds of syllogistic reasoning that involves all of these features\n1.​ Universal affirmative beliefs(A Propositions)\na)​ All S is P\n2.​ Particular affirmative beliefs(I Propositions)\na)​ Some S is P\n3.​ Universal negative beliefs(E propositions)\na)​ All S is not P\n4.​ Particular negative beliefs(O propositions)\na)​ Some S is not P\nE.​ Syllogisms are special arrangements of beliefs that have premises and conclusions\n1.​ A conclusion successfully follows from the premises when it expresses a\nvalid form and when all premises are true\n2.​ False premises do not necessitate a false conclusion\n3.​ Only 20 valid syllogisms\n4.​ Major term, middle term, minor term\na)​ Major term: First premise and contains middle and major term of\nthe conclusion\nb)​ Minor term: Second premise and contains the middle and minor\nterm of the conclusion\n5.​ Study valid syllogisms\na)​ Create an even playing field for syllogisms by making language\nconsistent - parameter\nI.​\nII.​\n\nModern Science\nA.​ Knowledge that is established through the empirical scientific method\nAristotle’s View of Science\nA.​ Knowledge that admits of a kind of comprehensiveness, foundation, and stability\n1.​ Involves demonstrations\na)​ A valid syllogism which produces a conclusion\nb)​ Conclusion produces knowledge of a certain high quality\n(1)​Identifies the causes that bring about the conclusion\nc)​ The science that follows from demonstration seeks to identify the\nrelations among fundamental principles that yield knowledge of\nother things\nB.​ Demonstration\n1.​ A deduction that produces knowledge of a certain kind\na)​ Connects science with syllogism rather than the empirical method\n2.​ A conclusion that is demonstrated is known by the person reflecting on\nthat demonstration\n\n\fC.​ Two Important Aspects of Scientific Knowledge\n1.​ Only that which is necessary can be known in this way\na)​ Expressed in the premises of the demonstration\n(1)​Need to identify stable and deep properties of things\n2.​ Scientific knowledge is the knowledge of causes\na)​ Knowledge is achieved when one comes to know through\ndemonstration\nb)​ The premises of a proposition need to involve propositions which\nare more familiar to us as to give rise to knowledge of the\nconclusion which itself is less familiar\n(1)​Demonstrations that proceed from cause to effect and from\neffect to cause\n3.​ Cause to effect\na)​ P1.

Knowledge begins as memories of the past and recognition of patterns\nthrough experience\na)​ May not show what works under all particular conditions\n2.​ Thoroughness of knowledge comes with memory of causes\na)​ Transcends particular memories from particular experiences\n3.​ The science for the most wise knows not only the causes but also the\nfundamental causes of things\na)​ The wise person knows why something brings something about\nMetaphysical Knowledge\nA.​ The metaphysician has knowledge as far as possible without having it about each\nparticular thing\nB.​ Metaphysics is the most universal science because it takes into consideration all\nknowledge\n1.​ It investigates the principles which give rise to all things known in various\nother sciences\nC.​ “The metaphysician is the one who is capable of knowing difficult things, that is\nthings not known by human beings and goes beyond mere sense perception.”\n1.​ Despite dealing with less causes of things, the principles metaphysics deal\nwith are difficult to identify due to not being immediately perceivable\nD.​ “The metaphysician is more exact and a better teacher of the causes.”\n1.​ Metaphysics shines light on a wide variety of things through only a few\nprinciples\n2.​ The metaphysician has a comprehensive grasp of things in an integrated\nand fundamental way\nE.​ “Metaphysics is more worthy for the sake of knowing it.”\n1.​ Although difficult to grasp, metaphysical principles are comprehensible in\nthemselves and give rise to all other things\nF.​ “Metaphysics orders the other sciences”\n1.​ Metaphysics has a controlling function to the other disciplines\n2.​ Just because metaphysics has a controlling function to other disciplines, it\ndoes not mean that all principles of those disciplines can be derived from\nmetaphysical principles directly\nG.​ Metaphysics is a kind of divine knowledge\n1.​ Transcends the human realm into the fundamental realm\n2.​ Studies divine things

critical reflection and systemization\nof our beliefs about human nature and fit it in the context of\nthe whole\n(a)​ Critical reflection: Subject a belief to scrutiny\nthrough arguments in support of and argument\nagainst a particular belief being true\nb)​ Philosophy begins with a broad collective human experience\n(1)​Symmington provides an example of the collective\nexperience of time consciousness(present, past, future)\n2.​ Metaphysics: The study of being as being, which seeks to discover the\nbasic attributes common to all beings, and establish the ultimate laws,\nprinciples, and causes of being itself\na)​ Father Clarke adds “ultimate laws, principles, and causes of being\nitself” to Aristotle’s definition to have both a broad understanding\nof being and ultimate understanding of being(ultimate source,\ncause, being in most preeminent way)\n\n\fII.​\n\n(1)​Symmington references the two parts of metaphysics(see\nScience of Metaphysics notes)\nb)​ Metaphysics connects back to the definition of philosophy by\nbeing critically reflective of what is being and a systematic\narticulation through a coherent system of beliefs\n(1)​Human experience is the content which metaphysics\nstudies\n(a)​ Symmington connects this with faith and divine\nrevelation\nThe Principles and Methodology of Metaphysics\nA.​ Principles\n1.​ All being is inherently intelligible(can be understood)\na)​ Truth can be obtained about every being\n(1)​Symmington provides a black hole example\nb)​ Counter: “Only a part of being is intelligible, some parts are\nfundamentally unintelligible”\n(1)​Can only understand as it relates to our survival\n(2)​Refute: Man has already come to understand principles,\nsuch as mathematics, that go beyond our environment or\nsense experience\n(a)​ Further, the point is paradoxical and collapses on\nitself, for the statement is not provable by sense\nexperience\n(b)​Man also has a drive to know that is greater than his\ndrive to survive\n2.​ Metaphysics makes us humble to truth to always know that human beings\nas such are deficient in their understanding of truth\na)​ Allows us to constantly grow in our intellect\n3.​ Metaphysics draws on resources of natural reason alone as applied to our\ncommon human experience\na)​ All concepts are derived in human experience\n4.​ Principle of Non-Contradiction: Nothing can be and not be at the same\ntime under the same aspect\na)​ Something cannot exist and not exist\nb)​ Therefore, no proposition or statement can be both asserted and\ndenied at the same time and under the same aspect\n(1)​Symmington provides an example that a figure cannot be\ntriangle and square\n5.​ Principle of Sufficient Reason: Every being has the sufficient reason for its\nexistence either in itself or in another\na)​ Has to be a sufficient reason for the existence of each particular\nobject\n6.​ Metaphysics proceeds from things more recognizable to our understanding\nand experience to things less recognizable\na)​ Begin with the common things and proceed from those concepts\n\n\f(1)​Symmington provides an example of material substance to\nimmaterial substance\nI.​\n\nII.​\n\nUnderstanding Being\nA.​ We are already familiarized with “being”\n1.​ We use “being” in our everyday sentences as the copula\na)​ Copula connects subject and predicate\nb)​
